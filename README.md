# Python-Cpp interface binding Experiments

## Calling python from cpp
- [x] matplotlib 

Initiate a python interpreter object and create interfaces between script and cpp. Ideally, the code could be edited on both sides (cpp computation and py visualize/statistics/etc)

- [ ] Data format 

Figure out a universal data format could easily transfer data between cpp and python, generally it should be able to carry basic types/array-like/matrix/tables. 

## Calling cpp from python
- [x] call cpp from py with arbitrary func

This should be supported with pybind11 class/function wrapper intuitively. All python utils should be open to this approach.
